# Lab42F

An escript `lab42_f` that uses a very concise but quite logic minilanguage for file manipulation

**N.B.**

This README contains the docstrings and doctests from the code by means of [extractly](https://hex.pm/packages/extractly)
and the following code examples are therefor verified with `ExUnit` doctests.


  f [filter_flags] [transformation]

  filter_flags:
    w <wildecard>  defaults to *

    t &lt;prefefined type>

    agt|alt|mgt|mlt <date time>

    sgt|slt &lt;file size>

    rgx &lt;rgx>

  &lt;date time> is either an absolute or relative value, see moduledoc of `Lab42.F.Time`
  transformation:
  a string in which %<exp> will be replaced as follows and all spaces will
  be ignored  (like in ~r{...}x)

  for each processed file (use %%<exp> for a literal %<exp>)

  &lt;<exp> depends on file:

      %p full relative path
      %px full relative path w/o last extension
      %pX full relative path w/o any extension
      %P full expanded (absolute) path
      %b file's base name with extension
      %B file's base name w/o last extension (x.y.z → x.y)
      %BX file's base name w/o all extensions (x.y.z → x)
      %d file's relative dir name
      %D file's expanded dir name
      %x file's last extension (x.y.z → z)
      %X file's extensions (x.y.z → y.z)

  <exp> is a random string:

  %r<random format>  a random string according to <random format> as follows
  x<n>  n hex digits, e.g. %rx10 → a0df128872


  <exp> constant:
  %s space (\u0020)



## &lt;date time> format

a time value can specified, either by relative values, like

`1_day_ago`

or by partial absolute values, still relative to the current date

`30` (30th of current month)
`12-01` (<current-year>-12-01T00:00:00Z)
`3 14`  (<current-year>-<current-month>-03T14:00:00Z)

or by complete timestamps (well hours, minutes and seconds still default to 0, and the century to 21)

`14-03-01` (2014-03-01T00:00:00Z)
`14-3-1 12` (2014-03-01T12:00:00Z)
